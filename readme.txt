=======================================NOTE===========================================================
Hello! Thank you so much for buying this addon and making this possible. It took A LOT of time and effort, so it would be very nice
for you rate it on Gmod Store. I hope you enjoy it!



=======================================Recommend Config ( important )==========================================================
1. As you may notice, if the LSD sheet had no protection, players would be able to spawn a lot of entities; thus likely
causing lag. By default, this addon has a configuration that limits players from cropping lots of pieces of the sheet. To see
the commands to customize these limits, read the section ConVars.

2. Make sure you only allow players to grab the entity "psychedelics_blotter_1sheet" and "psychedelics_mushroom3" in inventory/pockets.
By whitelisting other blotter entities, players may use this to bypass the crop limit.
